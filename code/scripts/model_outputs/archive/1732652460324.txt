You're right to point out the need for a more robust way to prevent hallucinations. A checklist is a good starting point, and I can suggest several strategies to improve my accuracy and adherence to your specifications:

**1. Parameter List Verification:** Before generating each command, I will cross-reference it against a structured list of valid parameters for each function.  This list can be stored internally, and I'll programmatically verify that the generated command contains only the allowed parameters and the correct number of them.

**2. Regular Expression Checks:** I can use regular expressions to validate the structure of each command. This will ensure the command string follows the defined pattern (e.g., `/generate function_name param1 param2 ...`).  This helps catch errors like extra parameters, missing parameters, or incorrect parameter order.

**3. Function Documentation Integration:**  If you can provide function definitions in a structured format (e.g., JSON or a simple table), I can parse that documentation and use it directly for validation, reducing the chance of manual errors in my internal representation of the functions.

**4. Example-Based Validation:** I can compare generated commands against a set of valid examples.  While this might not catch all possible hallucinations, it can help identify deviations from expected patterns.

**5. Unit Tests:** I can create unit tests for the command generation process. These tests would define specific input scenarios and expected outputs, allowing for automated verification of correctness.

**6. Internal Constraint Enforcement:** I can build internal logic to constrain the generation process. For example, knowing that a seed value is inappropriate for `lake` commands, I can explicitly prevent myself from adding a seed parameter during generation.

**7. Probabilistic Filtering:** I can use a probabilistic approach to filter out unlikely or invalid commands. This would involve training a model to estimate the probability of a command being valid based on the context and previously seen examples. Low-probability commands could then be flagged for review or discarded.

**8. User Feedback Loop:**  Even with automated checks, occasional hallucinations might slip through.  Integrating a user feedback loop, where you can easily correct or flag problematic commands, will help me learn and refine the generation process over time.  This feedback can be used to update the validation checks and improve my understanding of your requirements.


By implementing a combination of these techniques, I can significantly reduce hallucinations and increase the reliability of the generated commands. I will focus on implementing the Parameter List Verification and Regular Expression Checks first, as these are relatively straightforward to implement and should provide substantial improvement.  Let me know if you have a preferred approach or additional suggestions.
