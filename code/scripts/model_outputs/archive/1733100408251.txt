**Rationale and Continuity Considerations:**

* **Hills:** Consistent amplitude (28) maintains smooth transitions with central, eastern, and southern hills.  A new seed introduces variation in the terrain.
* **River:** The diagonal river flow (NW-SE) creates the possibility of connections with the southern or eastern rivers, enhancing the natural flow of the water system.
* **Lakes:**  Lakes are placed to avoid overlaps with existing lakes in the south and east regions.
* **Village:**  Southeast placement allows for a potential cluster with villages in those directions.
* **Forests:** The mixed forest is strategically positioned near the central bottom-right edge to allow for potential connections with central, eastern, *or* southern mixed forests, creating larger, more interconnected wooded areas.  The oak and birch forests are placed for variety and possible connections with forests to the far east or south.
* **Grass and Flowers:** Density and placement are consistent with other tiles.

This southeast tile generation emphasizes multi-tile blending, similar to the northwest and northeast generations. The focus on diagonal rivers and strategically placed mixed forests are key to creating a more natural and interconnected landscape.  The adjustments to the mixed forest's position are made to increase the likelihood of a connection with existing forests. I look forward to your feedback and to the challenge of generating the final corner tile!
