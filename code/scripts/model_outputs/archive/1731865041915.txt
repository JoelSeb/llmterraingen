Yes, I can create a conceptual representation of such a terrain using the functions you provided.  I can't directly execute Minecraft commands, but I can describe the process and the resulting landscape.  This will be a high-level description, as precise block-by-block generation would require more complex algorithms and direct game interaction.

**Terrain Initialization:**

1. **Flat Plains:** Start with a flat plane of grass blocks at y=62. This forms the base of our 256x64x256 terrain (x: 0-255, y: 62-125, z: 0-255).

**Village Generation:**

1. **Center Village:** Use `/generate village [127] [127]` to generate a village roughly in the center of the plains.  Since the terrain is flat at this stage, the village will be placed atop the grass blocks at y=62.  This will automatically create the necessary terrain adjustments for houses and paths within the village itself.

**Hill Generation:**

1. **Scattered Hills:** Now we add hills using `/generate hill`. We'll want to avoid placing hills too close to the village to prevent overlapping structures.  Here's an example of a possible hill distribution:
    * `/generate hill 50 50 15 30`  (A gentle hill in the northwest quadrant)
    * `/generate hill 200 200 20 25` (A slightly taller hill in the southeast quadrant)
    * `/generate hill 50 200 10 20`  (A smaller hill in the southwest quadrant)
    * `/generate hill 200 50 12 25` (Another hill in the northeast quadrant)
2. **Adjust Heights if needed**: Observe how the hills interact with the village. If they overlap or disrupt the village layout too much, adjust the `[HEIGHT]` and `[RADIUS]` parameters of the `/generate hill` commands until the village and hills coexist naturally.


**Refinement (Conceptual):**

While the above gives us the major features, further refinement would be necessary for a truly realistic plains biome:

* **Rivers and Lakes:**  Add rivers and lakes conceptually.  These would likely weave between the hills and perhaps near the village.  Consider how the terrain would slope down towards the water edges.
* **Scattered Trees:**  Imagine scattering oak trees in small clumps or individually across the plains.  The tree density should be relatively low.  Avoid overly regular patterns. Trees might cluster more near water sources.
* **Flowers:** Visualize flowers sprinkled randomly throughout the grassy areas. 
* **Village Refinements:**  Although the `/generate village` command creates a basic village, adding details like farms, paths, wells, and lamp posts can make it more believable.  Consider village size variation; some villages are bigger than others.
* **Biome Transitions:** If the terrain borders other biomes, consider how the plains would transition into those areas.  For example, if the edge meets a forest, the tree density would likely increase gradually.

**Example Output (Descriptive):**

The generated terrain is a vast, open plain with gentle rolling hills in each quadrant.  A village sits near the center, its wooden houses clustered around a well.  A wide, shallow river meanders from the west, flowing near the village before curving towards the south.  Small clumps of oak trees dot the landscape, with a slightly higher density near the riverbank.  Colorful flowers are sprinkled across the grass, creating a vibrant carpet. The hills add depth to the scene, providing vantage points and breaking up the flatness of the terrain.


This is a conceptual approach to your generation request.  The next step towards more automated and accurate generation would involve translating these high-level ideas into code or utilizing an existing Minecraft world manipulation tool that allows for programmatic terrain modification.
