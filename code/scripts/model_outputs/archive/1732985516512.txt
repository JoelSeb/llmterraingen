**Design Choices and Rationale:**

* **Hills:** Continued using a similar amplitude for the hills to maintain the general flatness of the plains, but introduced a new seed (345T) for variation within this southern region.

* **River:** Created a new river flowing roughly east-west, adding another major water feature to this area. The width is kept consistent at 4.  The seed is new.

* **Lakes:** Placed two lakes of varying sizes towards the center of the southern region, avoiding overlap with other features and mirroring the lake distribution pattern of other regions.

* **Forests:**  Generated oak, birch, and mixed forests with varied sizes, densities, and new seed values. They are placed to complement the existing forests in adjacent regions and avoid excessive clustering.

* **Grass and Flowers:**  Maintained the consistent grass patches and low-density flower distribution across the whole southern area using a new seed.


This generation continues the established patterns of the Plains biome, while ensuring the southern region has its unique characteristics. The aim is for a seamless transition with neighboring areas while providing enough variety to make exploration rewarding.
