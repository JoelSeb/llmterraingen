After analyzing the 300 screenshots of Minecraft Plains biomes, I've observed the following common features and patterns:

**Terrain:**

* **Generally flat:**  The defining characteristic is the expansive, relatively flat terrain.  Gentle rolling hills and shallow dips are common, but steep slopes and large mountains are rare.
* **Elevation variation:** While mostly flat, there's still subtle elevation change, creating visual interest.  These changes are usually gradual and smooth.
* **Water features:** Rivers and lakes are frequently found in plains biomes, sometimes cutting through the landscape, other times forming isolated bodies of water.  Their shapes vary from simple circles to winding, branching systems.  The edges of these water features are usually shallow and gradually deepen.

**Flora:**

* **Grass and tall grass:**  Plains are covered in a mix of grass and tall grass, giving them their characteristic green appearance.  The distribution of tall grass seems somewhat random but tends to appear in patches.
* **Trees:** Trees are present but not overly dense.  They often appear in small clusters or as solitary individuals.  Oak trees are the most common.  Occasionally, a larger forest might be found at the edge of the plains, blending into other biomes.
* **Flowers:**  A variety of flowers are scattered throughout the plains, adding splashes of color.  These appear individually or in small groups and seem randomly distributed.

**Structures:**

* **Villages:**  Plains villages are a common sight. They're characterized by their wooden structures and often located near water sources.  The size and layout of villages can vary.
* **Pillager Outposts:** These hostile structures are less frequent than villages, but still possible to encounter in plains. They're tall, dark, and easily recognizable.

**Absence of Features:**

* Notably absent are large mountains, cliffs, and other dramatic terrain features.  Dungeons, mineshafts, and other underground structures are not visible from this perspective.

**Distribution and Clustering:**

* Features like trees and flowers are often clustered rather than uniformly distributed.  Water features can meander across the landscape, influencing the placement of other features.  Villages are usually placed in relatively flat areas near water.

**Regarding future generation:**

Based on a provided section of a plains biome, I can attempt to generate surrounding areas by considering:

* **Terrain continuity:**  Smoothly transitioning the existing terrain height and slope into the new areas.  If there's a river flowing in, it should continue naturally, potentially branching or widening.
* **Feature density:**  Maintaining a similar density of trees, tall grass, and flowers to the given region.  If a village is partially visible, the remaining structures should be generated according to typical village layouts.
* **Biome blending:**  If the given section is close to the border of another biome, the generated area should reflect a gradual transition in terrain and features, blending the characteristics of both biomes.

I believe with more refined data and feedback, I can improve the accuracy and realism of generating plains biomes and their surroundings. This will involve not only analyzing overhead views like these screenshots but also incorporating information about the blocks beneath the surface.
