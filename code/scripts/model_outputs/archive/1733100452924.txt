**Rationale and Continuity Considerations:**

* **Hills:** Consistent amplitude (28) ensures smooth transitions with the central, western, and southern hills.  A new seed provides varied hill shapes.
* **River:** The diagonal river flow (NW-SE) creates opportunities for connection with the western or southern rivers, enhancing the natural water network.
* **Lakes:** Lakes are positioned to complement the existing lakes in the west and south and avoid overlaps, aiming for a natural distribution.
* **Village:**  Southwest placement allows for a potential western or southern village cluster.
* **Forests:** The mixed forest is strategically placed near the center for potential connections with mixed forests in the central, western, *or* southern tiles.  The oak and birch forests are positioned and sized for visual appeal, variety, and possible connections with adjacent forests, particularly the birch forest to the north and oak forest to the east.
* **Grass and Flowers:** Maintaining consistent parameters ensures a visually cohesive Plains biome.



This southwest tile generation shares the complexity of other corner tiles, needing to blend with three adjacent regions. The focus remains on dynamic river connections, strategically placed mixed forests for larger wooded areas, and a balanced distribution of other features.  Your feedback on how these blending techniques are working is very important as we continue!
