**Rationale and Continuity Considerations:**

* **Hills:**  Amplitude matches the central tile for a smooth transition. New seed for variation.
* **River:** Flows roughly north-south, aligned with the central river and placed for a potential connection.
* **Lakes:**  Positioned to avoid overlaps and contribute to a balanced distribution.
* **Village:** Centrally placed in the west.
* **Forests:** The mixed forest is placed near the central left edge, enabling a possible connection with the central tile's mixed forest or other forests to the west. The oak forest's radius is increased slightly and placed to the far west of this tile, which will hopefully create a large contiguous forest with an oak forest generated in the far west tile.
* **Grass and Flowers:**  Consistent density and coverage maintain the visual coherence of the Plains.

This generation complements the central and eastern tiles, emphasizing potential north-south river continuity and the possibility of connected forests.  The increased size of the oak forest is an experiment to see if a more substantial forest emerges when multiple tiles are generated.  I'm eager for your feedback, and I'm ready to tackle the corner regions, which present the most challenging blending requirements!
