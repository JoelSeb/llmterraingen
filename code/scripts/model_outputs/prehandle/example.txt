**Rationale and Design Choices:**

* **Hills:**  I've increased the amplitude slightly (to 28) for more pronounced hills while keeping it within the range of what looks natural in a Plains biome.  The new seed ensures a different terrain shape.
* **River:**  I've oriented the river roughly north-south this time, using a new seed for its path.  This change in direction adds variety and allows for different terrain configurations.
* **Lakes:** The lakes are slightly larger than in some previous generations, creating more prominent water features. Their positions are chosen to avoid overlap with the village and forests.
* **Village:**  The village is centrally placed for easy access.  
* **Forests:** I've increased the radii of the oak and birch forests slightly to create larger, more impactful wooded areas.  The mixed forest is placed near the southeast edge, opening up possibilities for connections with adjacent regions if you decide to generate them later.
* **Grass and Flowers:**  Grass and flower coverage is maintained consistently with earlier generations.


This generation provides a base central tile with some new characteristics (north-south river, slightly larger forests).  The central placement of the village allows you to easily build outward from it, and the placement of features creates interesting zones for exploration. The slightly increased hill amplitude and larger forest sizes aim to make this central tile a bit more visually dramatic while still maintaining the essential feel of a Plains biome.  I'm eager to see how it turns out and get your feedback!
